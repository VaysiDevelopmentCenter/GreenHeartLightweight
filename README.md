## GreenHeart Lightweight: A Compact, Efficient Agricultural Monitoring System

GreenHeart Lightweight is a streamlined version of the original GreenHeart system, designed specifically for Arduino drones. It provides essential agricultural monitoring capabilities in a lightweight and cost-effective package.

**Features**

* **Essential Sensors:** Incorporates a reduced set of sensors (temperature, humidity, light intensity, infrared and soil moisture) suitable for drone-based monitoring.
* **Data Acquisition and Processing:** Collects and processes sensor data on-board the drone to reduce data transmission.
* **Wireless Communication:** Uses efficient wireless protocols (Etecx / LoRa / BLE) to transmit data to a ground station or cloud-based platform.
* **Integration with Arduino Ecosystem:** Leverages the Arduino ecosystem for hardware compatibility and software development.

**Hardware Requirements**

* Arduino compatible board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, Mega)
* Sensor modules (e.g., temperature, humidity, light intensity, soil moisture, Infrared)
* Wireless communication module (LoRa / BLE / Etecx)
* Power supply (e.g., LiPo battery)

1. **Launch drone:** Deploy the drone equipped with the GreenHeart Lightweight system.
2. **Data collection:** The drone will collect sensor data and perform on-board processing.
3. **Data transmission:** Processed data will be transmitted to the ground station or cloud-based platform.
4. **Data analysis:** Analyze the collected data to gain insights into crop health, soil conditions, and environmental factors.

**Customization**

GreenHeart Lightweight is highly customizable. You can:

* Add or remove sensors based on your specific monitoring needs.
* Modify data processing algorithms to suit different applications.
* Integrate with additional hardware or software components.

**Troubleshooting**

If you encounter issues, refer to the documentation for the individual components and libraries.
